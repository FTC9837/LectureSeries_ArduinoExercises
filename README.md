![Blinking LED Diagram](/blinkingLEDdemo/blinkingLEDdemo_bb.png)

One LED will light up for one second, then go out for one second. This process will repeat indefinitely.


## Flowing LED

Six LEDs will light up one by one from left to right, and then go out one by one from right to left.
After that, the LEDs will light up one by one from right to left, and then go out one by one from left to right.
This process will repeat indefinitely.

Each LED will light up then turn off in a line from left to right, then do the same pattern from right to left. 
This process will repeat indefinitely.


## Opposite LED

LEDs will alternate between on and off, with odd pins in sync and even pins in sync.
This process will repeat indefinitely.
